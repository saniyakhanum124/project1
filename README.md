Log File Analyzer for Intrusion Detection

# 🧾 Log Analyzer Project

## 📌 Abstract

The Log Analyzer project automates the detection and classification of suspicious log activities from **Windows** and **Web** logs.
It leverages **pattern matching** and **regular expressions** to identify common attack types such as **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and **Brute Force attempts**.
This automation enhances real-time log monitoring and alert generation, reducing manual effort and improving cybersecurity incident detection.

## 💡 Introduction

In cybersecurity, analyzing system and web logs is crucial to detect potential threats and vulnerabilities.
Manual log inspection is inefficient, time-consuming, and prone to oversight.
The **Python-based automated Log Analyzer** integrates data from multiple log sources, processes them, and identifies suspicious or abnormal activities using regex-based detection and classification.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **Python 3**
* **Pandas** – for data manipulation
* **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** – for visualization
* **Regular Expressions (re module)** – for pattern-based attack detection
* **Jupyter Notebook / VS Code** – for implementation
* **CSV files** – for storing log data and output

---

## ⚙️ Steps Involved in Building the Project

1. **Data Collection** – Imported Windows and Web logs in CSV format.
2. **Data Cleaning** – Removed missing/irrelevant data and standardized column names.
3. **Suspicious Log Detection** – Applied regex rules to detect suspicious entries.
4. **Classification** – Categorized attacks into SQL Injection, XSS, and Brute Force.
5. **Visualization** – Displayed distribution using Seaborn charts.
6. **Report Generation** – Generated summary reports and exported suspicious logs to CSV.

## 🧩 Features

* Automated suspicious log detection from Windows and Web sources
* Regex-based attack classification (SQL Injection, XSS, Brute Force)
* Alert summary and exportable suspicious log reports
* Visual representation of log statistics

---

## 📊 Output

* Alerts summary report displayed in the console
* Suspicious logs saved in the `/alerts` folder (`suspicious_windows.csv`, `suspicious_web.csv`)
* Final summary file generated as `Suspicious_Log_Report.csv`

## ✅ Conclusion

The Log Analyzer successfully automates the detection and classification of suspicious log entries.
It offers an **efficient, scalable, and lightweight solution** for early-stage security monitoring and forensic analysis.
Future improvements may include integration with SIEM tools and **machine learning-based anomaly detection** for enhanced threat analysis.
